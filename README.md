# Fraud-detection
## Detecting Fraud payments using Machine Learning

###Dataset :
Dataset consist of 5 attributes :
1. Account age (in days)
2. numitems (number of items)
3. localTime (time of transaction)
4. PaymentMethod (method of payments eg. credit card, PayPal, etc.)
5. PaymentMethodAgeDays
6. label (binary values labelling whether the payment is fraud or not)

### The target is to predict the label from the new data.
The classification is Binary
The algorithm used is Logistic regression, a supervised learning algorithm
